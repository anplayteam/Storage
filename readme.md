## Log System

Two type of log exits. 
1. Main log `.log`
2. Sub logs like `.images_log`, `.videos_log`

### Main Log
Main Log will store every post request logs with datetime + ip

### Sub logs
Sub logs will only store upload logs of that specific fileid + datetime.

## Rest API

### Read

To access exits files just have send GET request with FileID.
If file exits then it will show or header to that file.

Ex- `{Path}/Storage/{FILEID}` or `{Path}/Storage?file={FILEID}`

### Write

To upload new files just have send POST request with `file`.
If Authentication exits then also have to send `key` with file POST request.

After successfully upload and processoring it will return status + file ids.
And also create a log.

### Delete

To Delete exits files just have to send Delete request with FileID (GET/POST);
If file exits then it will delete that file.

## Processors

### Image Processor

It will processor image file after uploading done. it will compress image by set level and change file type by set type.
It only support 'image/jpeg','image/png','image/gif' image files. Default Processor set to compress file 50% & type jpeg.
If you want to change then `*/System/imageProcessor.php` just find and edit it as your wish.
```php
$this->setting = array(
	'directory' => 'Images', // directory file compressed output
	'file_type' => array( // file format allowed
		'image/jpeg',
		'image/png',
		'image/gif'
	),
	'c_type' => 'jpeg',
	'level' => '5'
);
```

### Video Processor

It will processor/Encode video file after uploading done. it will create different encoding by set encoding and change file type by set type.
It only support 'video/mp4','video/mkv','video/avi' video files. Default Processor set to high(720p),mid(420p),low(360p) file & type always .mp4.
If you want to change then `*/System/videoProcessor.php` just find and edit it as your wish.
```php
$this->setting = array(
	'library' => 'System/ffmpeg/ffmpeg', // Full Address
	'directory' => 'Videos', // directory file compressed output
	'encode' => array(// name => resolution bitrates ffmpeg commands
		"high" => '-s hd720 -b:v 5000K -bufsize 5000K -b:a 192K',
		"midle" => '-s hd480 -b:v 2500K -bufsize 2500K -b:a 128K',
		"low" => '-s 480x360 -b:v 1000K -bufsize 1000K -b:a 128K'
	)
);
```
